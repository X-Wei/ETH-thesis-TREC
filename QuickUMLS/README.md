# QuickUMLS

QuickUMLS (Soldaini and Goharian, 2016) is a tool for fast, unsupervised  biomedical concept extraction from medical text.
It takes advantage of [Simstring](http://www.chokkan.org/software/simstring/) (Okazaki and Tsujii, 2010) for approximate string matching.
For more details on how QuickUMLS works, we remand to our paper.

This project should be compatible with both Python 2 and 3 and run on any UNIX system (sorry, no Windows support). **If you find any bugs, please file an issue on GitHub or email the author at luca@ir.cs.georgetown.edu**.

## Installation

#### Before Starting

1. This software requires all packages listed in the requirements.txt file. You can install all of them by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Note that, in order to use `spacy`, you are required to download its corpus. You can do that by running `python -m spacy.en.download`.
3. This system requires you to have a valid UMLS installation on disk. The installation can be remove once the system has been initialized.

#### To get the System Running

1. Download and compile Simstring by running `bash setup_simstring.sh <python_version>`, where `<python_version>` is either "`2`" or "`3`".
2. Initialize the system by running `python install.py <umls_installation_path> <destination_path>`, where `<umls_installation_path>` is where the installation files are (in particular, we need `MRCONSO.RRF` and `MRSTY.RRF`) and `<destination_path>` is the directory where the QuickUmls data files should be installed. This process will take between 5 and 30 minutes depending how fast is the drive where UMLS and QuickUMLS files should be stored.

## APIs

A QuickUMLS object can be instantiated as follows:

```python
>>> matcher = QuickUMLS(quickumls_fp, overlapping_criteria, threshold,
                        similarity_name, window, accepted_semtypes)
```

Where:

- `quickumls_fp` is the directory where the QuickUmls data files are installed.
- `overlapping_criteria` (default: "score") is the criteria used to deal with overlapping concepts; choose "score" if the matching score of the concepts should be consider first, "length" if the longest should be considered first instead.
- `threshold` (default: 0.7) is the minimum similarity value between strings.
- `similarity_name` (default: "jaccard") is the name of similarity to use. Choose between "dice", "jaccard", "cosine", or "overlap".
- `window` (default: 5) is the maximum number of tokens to consider for matching.s
- `accepted_semtypes` (default: see `constants.py`) is the set of UMLS semantic types concepts should belong to. Semantic types are identified by the letter "T" followed by three numbers (e.g., "T131", which identifies the type *"Hazardous or Poisonous Substance"*). See [here](https://metamap.nlm.nih.gov/Docs/SemanticTypes_2013AA.txt) for the full list.

To use the matcher, simply call

```python
>>> text = "The ulna has dislocated posteriorly from the trochlea of the humerus."
>>> matcher.match(text, best_match=True, ignore_syntax=False)
```

Set `best_match` to `False` if you want to return overlapping candidates, `ignore_syntax` to `True` to disable all heuristics introduced in (Soldaini and Goharian, 2016).
